## Overview
Projects executed using Machine Learning models and Deep Learning techniques 
## Contents
1. **Classification and Prediction of Lung Cancer.ipynb**: This notebook implements ML models to classify types of lung cancer and predict patient outcomes from histopathological image data.
2. **DNA Sequencing with ML.ipynb**: Here, we apply ML techniques to DNA sequencing data to identify genetic markers that may indicate susceptibility or resistance to certain lung conditions.
3. **Detection of Pneumonia and COVID-19 from Chest X-Rays.ipynb**: A deep learning approach is employed to distinguish between chest X-ray images displaying signs of pneumonia, COVID-19, and those without pathological findings.

## Installation
